# Awesome Research Software Engineering Policies and Guidelines [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated awesome list of Research Software Engineering (RSE) policies and guidelines. Inspired by [these curated collections](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).


## Contents
- [RSE policies](#rse-policies)

## RSE policies
Collection of RSE policies, which are abstract and often formal rules for research software engineering.

- [Caltech Copyright and Software Policy](https://innovation.caltech.edu/patents-licensing/policies/caltech-copyright-and-software-policy)
- [TU Delft Research Software Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629661)

## RSE guidelines
Collection of RSE guidelines containing recommendations and best practices for research software engineering in specific situations.

- [Guide and checklists of the DLR Software Engineering Initiative](https://rse.dlr.de/01_guidelines.html)
- [Guides and checklists of the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/guides)
- [Guides and checklists of the Netherlands eScience Center](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/)
- [Software Assessment Guidelines of the Earth Science Information Partners](https://esipfed.github.io/Software-Assessment-Guidelines/)
- [Software Guidelines of the IPOL Journal](https://tools.ipol.im/wiki/ref/software_guidelines/)
- [Software Quality Guidelines of CLARIAH](https://github.com/CLARIAH/software-quality-guidelines)

## Recommendations and HowTos for RSE policies and guidelines
No policies, no guidelines, but advice on how to write these documents.

- [Checklist to Support the Helmholtz Centers in Implementing Policies on Sustainable Research Software](https://doi.org/10.48440/os.helmholtz.038)
- [Model Policy on Sustainable Software at the Helmholtz Centers](https://doi.org/10.48440/os.helmholtz.041)
- [Positionspapier: Umgang mit Forschungssoftware an der Universität Stuttgart (german only)](https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/bitstream/11682/11195/1/positionspapier.pdf)
- [Recommendations for the Implementation of Guidelines and Policies on Research Software Management at the Helmholtz Centers](https://doi.org/10.48440/os.helmholtz.040)

## Open source policies and guidelines
Open source software and research software share many characteristics. Since there is no list about open source policies and guidelines in the research field we choose to mention it here. Research software engineering can learn a lot from the open source movement - also regarding policy and guideline development.

- [ESA Open Source Policy](https://essr.esa.int/esa-open-source-policy)
- [Hinweise zur Entwicklung von Open-Source-Software an der Universitätsbibliothek Leipzig](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6412930)
- [Open Source Policy of Aalto Scientific Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/aalto/opensource-policy/)
- [Open Source Software Policy of UNT Libraries](https://library.unt.edu/policies/open-source-software/)
- [(the struggle) Towards and open source policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00534v1)
